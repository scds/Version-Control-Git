# Welcome to Version Control with Git. 

This workshop will give you a solid introduction to Git. Git is software originally designed to help manage vast, decentralized software projects with hundreds of authors, but it works just as well with many things that arenâ€™t software, like data and text. Imagine having a complete archive of your work at every stage in its development! This workshop assumes no prior experience.

Proceed to the [Preparation](preparation) page to get started.
